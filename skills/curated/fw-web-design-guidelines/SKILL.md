# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. Read the guidelines from the local `command.md` file in this skill directory
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The complete rules are stored locally in:

```
command.md
```

Read this file to get all the rules and output format instructions. No external fetch needed.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read `command.md` from this skill directory
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
